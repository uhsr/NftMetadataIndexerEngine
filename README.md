# NftMetadataIndexerEngine

## Description



## Features

- Indexes NFT metadata using a distributed key-value store for scalability.
- Implements a GraphQL API endpoint for querying NFT metadata with advanced filtering capabilities.
- Utilizes a message queue system (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous processing of NFT events.
- Deploys a data pipeline for extracting and transforming NFT metadata from various blockchain sources.
- Employs a caching layer (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load and improve query performance.
- Supports configurable metadata schema validation to ensure data consistency across different NFT standards.
- Integrates with decentralized storage solutions (e.g., IPFS, Arweave) to resolve off-chain metadata references.
- Monitors and alerts on data ingestion pipeline failures using Prometheus and Grafana.
