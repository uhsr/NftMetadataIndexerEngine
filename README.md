# NftMetadataIndexerEngine

## Description

A smart contract suite implementing a novel NFT fractionalization and redistribution mechanism using a Merkle tree-based claim system for gas-efficient ownership management and royalties.

## Features

- Utilizes a distributed caching layer with Redis for low-latency metadata retrieval.
- Implements an event listener service consuming blockchain events via WebSockets for real-time indexing.
- Leverages a graph database, such as Neo4j, to model complex NFT relationships and enable advanced querying.
- Supports configurable data transformation pipelines using Apache Kafka Streams to normalize metadata formats.
- Integrates with IPFS gateways and decentralized storage solutions for content addressability and persistence.
- Provides a REST API with rate limiting and authentication using JWTs for secure access to indexed metadata.
- Offers a modular architecture allowing for pluggable metadata parsers supporting various NFT standards (ERC-721, ERC-1155).
- Automatically detects and handles metadata updates through smart contract event monitoring and periodic re-indexing.
